#blackout on

A cluttered office/laboratory. Through the window, the faint outline of a coastline is visible. The Professor is facing away from the Player, sorting papers. A young man stands nearby, perhaps still holding internship documents. There's a subtle tension in the air.

#speakers Player Professor

Player: Professor, this Bayvan ecological survey... it's just collecting a few samples and writing a report?
Player: Sounds like my thesis will be easier than I thought.

The Professor doesn’t turn around right away, pausing mid-motion.
Professor: …Samples, yes. But records, too.

He turns to face you, holding a slightly worn, intricately structured orb-like device.
Professor: Use this. The core recording unit.

Player: The EcoSphere? Isn’t it from the old ‘Living Recorder’ project that got shelved? I heard there were… incidents.
Professor: It records resonance. The real truth hiding behind data.
Player: Resonance? You mean…

Professor: ...Especially the kind of “real” you find after a disaster.

Research my thesis using that blacklisted device? Well… He knew about those accident briefings and never said a word.

Bayvan… Is there something there for you, Professor?

-> DONE

===0_1_0_VC_Outside===

Bayvan Visitor Center exterior. 
Sunlight blazes down, waves dull and listless, with something stirring in the air.

#speakers Player

Player: Huh, the visitor center’s newer than I expected. Not bad.
Player: Though that murky sea… the dead pier… and that smell in the air…
Player: Seems Professor really brought something for me.
Player: Guess I'd better go find Ms. Ella. He said she’s handling my onboarding. 
Player: Let's see if there's anyone in the visitor center that knows where she is.

A sweet voice from a speaker:
Welcome to Bayvan Eco-Park! Experience pristine nature and enjoy the harmony of coexistence! Today’s feature: “The Mayor and the Sea” photography exhibit—relive our pioneer glory!

#speakers Player
Player: Pristine? Coexistence? Really?… Hey Sphere, you’re the “Living Recorder.” Got anything to say?

# speakers Player frontdesk

Front Desk: ...Yes, yes, Ella! The person is here—looks like a student... holding a weird ball? ...Got it, I'll say you were delayed by an urgent interview at the sewage plant, and tell him to—what? Take photos of the sediment? Noted, noted!

He sees you, immediately hangs up, takes a deep breath, and forces a professional smile.

Front Desk: Sorry for the wait! Miss Ella was just called away for an urgent interview at the sewage plant! She apologizes and said you can go meet her directly in the new district!

He hands you a business card.

Front Desk: Here's the address, it's really easy to find!

You take the note. Suddenly, your phone vibrates violently in your pocket.

Player: ...?

Player: Urgent interview at the sewage plant? Seriously?

Your phone screen lights up, a new email. Who could it be?

Sender: [Data Deleted], Subject: For the person with the orb. 

Email Body: Research station, Basement Level 3, Section B, sample port of the recirculating water tank. This is a real water sample. Don’t trust their "qualified" report. The arsenic adsorption data was manually smoothed. The attachment is the original graph.  
Email Body: (Attachment: An arsenic concentration monitoring line chart. Most of the line is a smooth green, but one point is circled in red, showing a sudden spike. Beside it is a small note: Sample Point: Fisherman’s Village Well – 7/14.)

Player: (pupils contract, finger sliding across that glaring red spike on the screen):  
Player: Manually smoothed...? Qiu? The genius sampler Professor mentioned—the one who left the project? He sent me an email? Arsenic... Fisherman’s Village Well?

// Triggers immediately upon exiting the visitor center. Background zooms out.
At the dock, a disheveled, middle-aged man hurls a bucket of rotting fish onto the deck of a shiny new tourist yacht.
The fish gills shimmer with strange metallic blue blotches. Several Bayvan tourism staff are around him.

#speakers Mateo Security

Security A: Mateo! What the hell?! The tourists are watching!
Mateo: Let them watch! The blue on those gills? Same crap from your discharge pipes!
Mateo: Three years! What did you bring to us?! Huh?!

Security B: Everything was fine! The experts said it’s a rare red tide—
Mateo: Red tide?! The fish Noah pulled out before he died looked just like this! You gonna say he drowned in a “rare red tide” too?!

The moment he says “Noah,” their faces twist. Movements freeze.
In the chaos, Mateo’s bloodshot eyes lock on the Sphere in your hands.

Mateo: Another damn recorder?! Fine! Great! Tell those lab coats this——Their “clean” data can’t keep a single fish alive.
Mateo: And sure as hell can’t bring Noah back!

The beach fell silent.
The orb trembling slightly in your hands, cloudy swirls rising inside it.

#speakers Player Qiu 

Outside the Baylan Laboratory of Environments.
You walk across a gravel path and spot a man standing at the gate.  
Player: Excuse me… Are you Mr Qiu? My Professor said a senior researcher was stationed here.  
Player: He also asked me to bring this along—said maybe it could still be of use.
Qiu: Hmmm…Welcome. 
The moment he sees the Orb on your hand, something shifts subtly in his expression.
Qiu: Well, so he still remembers it.  
Qiu: It’s not that it’s useless. It’s that no one wants to be responsible for what happens after it works.
Player: You mean the incident? The files I found... they’re all redacted.

Qiu: The things you should find, you won’t. And the things you won’t find, I won’t tell.  
Qiu: Let me see... if I remember correctly, it works like this...

You hand him the eco-orb. You notice the suspended particles inside begin to shift. 
Under some strange force, they disassemble and recombine—gradually forming a faint, symbolic pattern.

Qiu: It activates near a live sample source. Just keep it away from strong electromagnetic fields. And whatever you do, don’t let it touch seawater.

Player: My advisor said it records "resonance," not just numbers.

Qiu: Resonance is data. Just not the kind that looks good on a spreadsheet.  
Qiu: But sometimes... what it shows—well, you’ll see once you start recording.

He hands the orb back and gestures toward the beach and the tourist center in the distance.  
Qiu: I doubt you're here just to admire the station. Others have noticed the problem before you did.

Player: Who?

Qiu: A journalist. Name's Ella. She doesn’t wait for permission to start digging.

Player: You know her?

Qiu: She asks the kind of questions you’re carrying too. Maybe the two of you will find some answers together.

He unlocks the door to the research station, but doesn’t step inside right away.  
Qiu: While you’re in Bihaven, I’ll help where I can... Just don’t expect too much.  
Qiu: What you learn depends on what you’re willing to ask. But don’t take too long. Some people are running out of time.

#speakers Player Mateo 

At the edge of the fishing village, the rusted utility poles are covered with hand-written posters. In the distance, you spot Mateo pasting another one onto a stone wall.

He notices you approaching. His eyes settle first on the orb at your waist, then on your face.

Mateo: So you’re the new keeper of that thing? Hah, what a cursed reunion.

Player: No need to be so tense. I'm just a student assistant. Got this thing a couple days ago. My professor said it might "come in handy," but honestly, I still don’t know how it works.

Mateo studies you for a moment. His gaze softens slightly, though there's still a wary edge to it.

Mateo: You lab-coat types like to talk about "objective recordings"—but we fishermen, we read the waves, the water, the eyes of the fish. What your gadget shows is only what someone up top wants you to see.

Player: That’s exactly why I’m here. To see more. I heard things aren't right around here. If you're willing, I'd like to hear your side.

He doesn’t reply immediately, but then he tears off one of the posters and hands it to you.

Mateo: We used to live off this sea. These days, it’s more like it’s swallowing us. Look around—boats rot faster, fish float belly-up, and nobody gives a damn.

Player: You mean… Noah?

Mateo’s face stiffens. His voice drops.

Mateo: The fish he pulled up right before he died looked exactly like the ones I dumped at the dock. But the report called it a "rare red tide." You think that’s a coincidence?

Player: If someone really is covering this up, I want to find out. Maybe the orb can still record something real.

He watches you in silence for a few seconds, then nods.

Mateo: If you’ve got the guts, go look. Don’t trust the research folks too much. Hell, don’t trust me either. But if you’ve got the guts to face the truth, I’ll walk with you a while. Maybe this time, we can save more than just a few fish.

    The moment you step into the fishing village, a strange tension settles in your chest.
    The sea breeze blows as usual, the sun beats down—yet there’s something uneasy in the air, something you can’t quite name.
    You wander forward without a clear aim and spot an old fisherman by the dock, mending his nets.
    Your eyes meet. He gives you a small nod.
    You walk over.

    Player: Nice weather today, sir.
    Old Fisherman: Yeah... the sea’s gotten a few degrees warmer. The fish don’t follow their old routes anymore.
    He lets out a sigh, then slowly begins to talk about the old days of the village.
    You listen, half-lost in thought.

    #speakers Mateo OldFisherman
    
    Your boots hit the dock with a familiar creak of old wood.
    The wind carries a hint of briny rot, but you barely notice.
    This is home—the place you return to, again and again.
    Off in the distance, the old fisherman always sitting in the shadows, mending his nets, gives you a wave.
    
    Old Fisherman: Matteo? Back again already, huh?
    Mateo: Yeah. Just did my good deed for the day.
    Old Fisherman: Hm… right. I saw something earlier, near the water out front.
    As he says “something,” his eyes flicker briefly, then glance over at you without a hint of expression.
    Old Fisherman: You might want to… take a look.
    You don’t answer. You just slowly turn your gaze in the direction he pointed.

{ get_current_character() == "Player":
It's a sea turtle, long dead. 
You crouch down. The device in your hand gives a faint buzz.
It seems to be prompting you to collect seawater.
The water is murky, with unidentifiable debris drifting through it—something about it feels... off.
You pause, then carefully take note of everything.

#ecosphere 1_1_WaterSample

//Mateo
As you approach the beach, the device hums low in your hand.
You see the waves dragging something heavy toward shore.
A sea turtle. The familiar notch on its shell tells you everything you need to know.
It’s her. The one you’ve passed at dusk, again and again, in silence.
You kneel. Your fingers hover above the cold, mottled shell.
You never spoke. But you remembered each other.
You stood there, eyes down as the tide washes up your legs.
